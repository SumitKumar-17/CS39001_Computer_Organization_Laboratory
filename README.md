This repository contains all my assignments of Computer Organization Laboratory.

The final work of this lab was to develop a Mini RISC processor from scratch
# MiniRISC: A Custom 32-bit RISC Processor

MinRISC (Minimal Simple RISC) is a custom-designed 32-bit RISC processor architecture built from the ground up, capable of performing a wide variety of arithmetic, logical, shift, and memory operations. It includes extended branching and jump capabilities, and has been successfully demonstrated on a Nexys 4 FPGA using programs like bubble sort and GCD.

## Features

* **64 General-Purpose Registers** – 4x the register file of MIPS.
* **Extended Branch/Jump Range** –

  * Relative Branch: 128× MIPS range
  * Absolute Jump: 4× MIPS range
* **Arithmetic & Logic Instructions**

  * `ADD`, `SUB`, `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `NOT`, `NOR`, `INC`, `DEC`, `SLT`, `SGT`
* **Shift Instructions**

  * `SLA`, `SRA`, `SRL`
* **Other Instructions**

  * `LUI` (Load Upper Immediate)
  * `HAM` (Hamming Weight)
  * `CMOV` (Conditional Move)
  * `MUL`, `DIV`
* **Fully custom ALU operation decoding**
* **Memory & Control Instructions** including loads, stores, branches, and jumps


## Implementation Details

* **Language:** Verilog (Synthesized for Nexys 4)
* **Registers:** 64 general-purpose 32-bit registers
* **ISA:** Custom RISC-style instruction set, extending MIPS-style encoding
* **Pipeline:** Single-cycle implementation (optional for multicycle extension)
* **Assembler:** Custom assembler written in Python 3
* **Simulation/Testbench:** Full test suite validating ALU and control logic

## Demonstrations

* [ ] **Bubble Sort** implemented and simulated 
* [ ] **GCD Algorithm** tested end-to-end on FPGA
* [ ] **Booth Multiplication** with all the intermediate results 
* [ ] All ALU operations verified using custom Python-based assembler and test harness

### FPGA Deployment

Synthesize using Vivado and upload bitstream to your FPGA. 

My Codes were tested upon a Digilent Nexys 4 DDR Artix-7 FPGA.

## Future Work

* Add pipelining or multi-cycle execution
* Memory-mapped I/O for peripheral interfacing
* Support for floating-point operations
* Better assembler error handling and pseudo-instruction support
