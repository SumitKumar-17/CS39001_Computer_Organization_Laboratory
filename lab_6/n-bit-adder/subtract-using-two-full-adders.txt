Subtraction using Full Adders:
To subtract two n-bit numbers, you can use the Full Adder circuit by interpreting the subtraction as an addition problem with the concept of two's complement.


Steps:
1)Take the two's complement of the number to be subtracted. The two's complement of a number is obtained by inverting all the bits and then adding 1 to the result.
2)Add the original number to the two's complement of the number to be subtracted using the Full Adder.
3)The result will be the difference between the two numbers, and any carry-out from the most significant bit (MSB) of the Full Adder will indicate whether there was a borrow.

Design for n-bit Difference:
You would use n Full Adders connected in series to handle n-bit numbers. The carry-in of each Full Adder is the borrow from the previous stage.
