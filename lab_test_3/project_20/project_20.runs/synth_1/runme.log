Resolution: Check if the specified object(s) exists in the current design. If it does, ensure that the correct design hierarchy was specified for the object. If you are working with clocks, make sure create_clock was used to create the clock object before it is referenced.

INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [C:/Users/Student/project_20/project_20.srcs/constrs_1/imports/lab_test/pin.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/gcd_module_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/gcd_module_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.
