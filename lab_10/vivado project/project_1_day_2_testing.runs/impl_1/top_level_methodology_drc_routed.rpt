Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.076 ns between c0/ct_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk) and c0/ct_reg[7]/R (clocked by clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -2.085 ns between c6/ct_reg[0]/C (clocked by clk) and c6/ct_reg[12]/R (clocked by clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
